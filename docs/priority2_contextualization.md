# Priority 2 — Initial Contextualization (2–3 pages draft)

## Positioning: Why an IEA‑SCALE–inspired approach for SMEs
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) represent a major share of employment and value creation, yet they encounter structural barriers to adopting formal foresight and environmental scanning practices. These constraints include limited human and financial resources, lack of dedicated information systems, centralized decision-making, and a predominance of short-term operational horizons. In practice, these conditions reduce sustained attention for systematic anticipation and make robust scanning difficult to institutionalize. fileciteturn5file0

The case of IEA‑SCALE addresses this gap by adapting the LESCAAI orientation to resource‑constrained environments through a hybrid model that combines partial automation with collective interpretation across organizational networks. Rather than replacing human judgement, AI is used to reduce the cost of pre‑processing and to expand the feasible scope of scanning, while sensemaking and strategic framing remain explicitly human responsibilities. fileciteturn5file0

## A key theoretical premise: weak signals as cognitive constructs
A core premise is that weak signals are not objective data points waiting to be “found.” They emerge when someone notices, shares, and interprets marginal cues within a specific context. This makes weak-signal work inseparable from cognition, attention, and social interpretation. Consequently, a system cannot be evaluated only by retrieval accuracy; it must be evaluated by how well it supports responsible interpretation and collaborative learning. fileciteturn5file0

## From standard RAG to SCALE‑inspired three‑tower intelligence
Standard Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically retrieve semantically similar documents, pass them as context to a language model, and produce a consolidated answer. The SCALE‑inspired approach extends this logic by imposing a hierarchical information architecture and by foregrounding traceability and collective interpretation. fileciteturn5file1

The educational implementation is organized as a three‑tower architecture enabling “telescopic navigation”:
- **Tower 1 (Strategic Insight):** an executive synthesis that highlights novelty and strategic relevance.
- **Tower 2 (Thematic Contexts):** explanatory narratives that connect the insight to broader drivers and implications.
- **Tower 3 (Documentary Fragments):** traceable evidence units with metadata, allowing verification and debate. fileciteturn5file1

This design is not merely a formatting choice: it operationalizes governance requirements by ensuring that every insight is auditable and that users can move from high‑level framing to granular evidence when decisions are contested or high‑stakes.

## Human‑in‑the‑loop and network collaboration as design principles
In IEA‑SCALE, partial automation supports initial detection, clustering, and pre‑processing, while network collaboration distributes scanning effort and diversifies interpretive perspectives. The architecture preserves structured collective sensemaking sessions as a “control point” to mitigate algorithmic bias, over‑reliance, and interpretive homogenization. fileciteturn5file0

For educational purposes, this principle is translated as explicit checkpoints where students must inspect intermediate outputs (chunks, retrieved contexts, tower drafts) and document how human judgement altered or rejected machine-generated content. This emphasis aligns with the guide’s focus on transparency, traceability, and iterative learning rather than “set-and-forget” automation. fileciteturn5file3

## Why a public repository matters for the chapter
To support replicability, the chapter can cite an accompanying public repository containing a simplified educational pipeline. The repository is not meant to replicate the proprietary production system; instead, it demonstrates core architectural principles and provides scaffolding for students and other laboratories to build their own implementations using open-source tools. fileciteturn5file1

## Limits and responsible use
Several limitations should be explicit:
- AI curation can reinforce representational biases or miss truly novel patterns.
- Users may over‑trust authoritative-looking summaries.
- Output quality depends on the diversity and currency of sources.
- Continuous governance and facilitation remain necessary. fileciteturn5file4

Therefore, the educational implementation is framed as a cognitive amplifier that supports anticipatory governance by widening scanning capacity while keeping interpretation, ethical judgement, and strategic responsibility under human control. fileciteturn5file4
